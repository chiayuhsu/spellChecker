# spellChecker
ASU CSE360 Team Project 

This is ASU CSE360 Team Project. We build a spell checker with GUI using java.
There are several functions we made:

1.  The program prompt for the name of the input text file and the dictionary.  Only text files should be used.
2.  The program display all words from the input text file that do not appear in the dictionary and allow the user to
  a.  Ignore the word
  b.  Add the word to the dictionary
3.  All case and punctuation on input should be ignored.
4.  The dictionary is stored internally in an efficient manner.
5.  Duplicate errors should not be displayed.
6.  The program handle multiple input files and dictionary files.
7.  The user should have the option of storing all text and words before opening another file.
8.  There is a GUI with a help screen.
9.  Replacement: Add the replacement functionality to your code. Display all the words in the input file in a text box in your  GUI. User selects the word(s) and clicks the “Replace” button. Display a prompt and store the new user input in the input file. The user can then decide to add/ignore the word(s). 
10.	Statistics: Add a button to display the statistics for the current input-dictionary file pair. Number of words in the input file, number of words replaced, number of words added to dictionary, number of lines read from the input file and number of words ignored. Store the information in a separate file for every input-dictionary file pair. While saving, make sure you store the proper information.
